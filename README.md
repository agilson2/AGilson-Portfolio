# Tools for Bioinformatics
A final portfolio for Bioinformatics: Tools for Genome Analysis (AS.410.635.81) in the JHU IGH program.
This portfolio contains examples of experience with various bioinformatic tools, of lessons learned and discussions partaken in.
Sections have been split in this repository relating to examples of different tools used during the BTGA course and others
such as Next Generation DNA Sequencing Analysis and Genomic Expression Data Analysis and Visualization.
*Each file on GitHub has a .txt file that describes each in detail.*

## [Coursework from Bioinformatics: Tools for Genome Analysis](https://github.com/agilson2/AGilson-Portfolio/tree/main/BTGA%20Classwork)
* Both reading summaries and discussion posts from throughout the spring 2021 semester in Bioinformatics: Tools for Genome Analysis
* Reading summaries were completed every week to synthesize the most important points from each week's lecture. 
  * These are broken up by individual units.
  * These units all contained information about tools that were later applied to the research paper and assingments.
* Class Discussions were in relation to the unit's subject each week, but went beyond the base level of the lectures to spark interesting conversation.

## [Galaxy and Other Bioinformatic Tools](https://github.com/agilson2/AGilson-Portfolio/tree/main/Galaxy%20and%20Other%20Tools) 
* Contains multiple different examples from various tools.
* Most folders contain supplementary files that relate to the data presented in the file.

### [Galaxy](https://github.com/agilson2/AGilson-Portfolio/tree/main/Galaxy%20and%20Other%20Tools/Galaxy)
* Galaxy is an open source platform in which users can more easily manipulate bioinformatic data, found [here](https://usegalaxy.org/).
* Through this platform, I was exposed to a variety of different file formats including BED, WIG, BAM, SAM, and many others. 
* The main focus of using Galaxy in the BTGA course was to facilitate the analysis of larger datasets.

### [Genome Browsers](https://github.com/agilson2/AGilson-Portfolio/tree/main/Galaxy%20and%20Other%20Tools/Genome%20Browsers)
* A genome browser presents a unique visual and graphical display of information from a dataset that wouldn't otherwise be seen.
* Integrative Genomics Viewer
* NCBI Genome Browser
* UCSC Genome Browser
* Ensembl
