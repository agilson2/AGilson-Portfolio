Split between units 1-7 and 8-14 as 1-7 are part of units that deal with the 
technical details of the different programs used throughout the semester and 
for the final project. Units 8-14 go into more detail about the various 
applications for which those tools can be used, and other sources of data 
from which genomic analyses can be completed. Please refer to the reading 
summaries file folder to read more about each unit's subject in more detail.
