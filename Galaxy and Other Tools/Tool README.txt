Many tools were used throughout the semester in the Bioinformatics: Tools for 
Genome Analysis course, as well as the rest of my courses during my time in the 
JHU Individualized Genomics and Health. During the course, multiple assignments 
were assigned that mirrored the course work, with exams  (see the Reading Summary
Folder for notes from each unit). These have been separated into folders based on
what tools were used to accomplish each task. There are also a few supplementary
files that are present in each where the files coulnd't be presented in a 
reasonable manner within the PDF (such as Galaxy Workflows).
