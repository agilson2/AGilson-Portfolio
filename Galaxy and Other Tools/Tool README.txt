Many tools were used throughout the semester in the Bioinformatics: Tools for 
Genome Analysis course. During the course, multiple assignments were assigned that
mirrored the course work (see the Reading Summary Folder for notes from each 
unit). A folder was created for each of these assignments. Along with a PDF
from each assignment submission, files from each assignment were included that 
demonstrate my proficiency in using the tools required for each assignment.

Examinations during the semester are also provided to further demonstrate 
proficiency in using these bioinformatic tools. See the "Practical 
Examinations" folder for these.
